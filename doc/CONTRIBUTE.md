============

Please do! Seriously if it's sane and looks like reasonable Perl6 I will likely accept it.

###Matt's TODO soon list
- Get some tests in for nucleotide sequences
- Make a little six-frame translator script using the library
- Get some Newick Actions together along with some very very basic PhyloTree classes
- Actually do some design, perhaps via TDD
- Make some delicious POD6 inline documentation

###Low Hanging (Juicy) Fruit For Anyone
- Add methods/attributes to various sequence classes, could be anything!
- Perhaps extend FASTA parsing to do specific comment strings like GenBank etc.
- Add in bindings to webservices you like
- Add some new funky file format you like
- Work out a nice class to do sequence annotations
- Checkout SVG/SVG::Plot and come up with some vis stuff. For inspiration check out one I made earlier in Perl5 http://d2p2.pro/view/sequence/hs/ENSP00000269305
- Play with BagHash and friends to do some fun stats modelling modules
